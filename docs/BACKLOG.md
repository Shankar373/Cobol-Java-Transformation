## P0 — correctness, capability truth, trust

### BL-001 — Producer capability declaration contradicted the authoritative registry
- **Type:** defect (capability truth)
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this audit/implementation session)
- **Observed behavior:** `engine/transformation/producers/internal_native.py` returned
  a hand-maintained `supported_constructs`/`unsupported_constructs` list on every
  `TransformationResult`. It declared `GO TO` **supported** (registry: UNSUPPORTED),
  `OCCURS` supported (no registry key; mapping unverified), and `COMPUTE`,
  `SUBTRACT`, `MULTIPLY`, `CALL`, `EVALUATE` **unsupported** (registry: SUPPORTED).
- **Expected behavior:** Producer metadata must never contradict the authoritative
  registry (`engine/transformation/semantic_capability.py`), per Master README
  Sections 14 and 77 and `docs/COBOL_UNIVERSALITY_ROADMAP.md` P0-1.
- **Root cause:** Stale duplicated capability list that drifted from the registry.
- **Affected files:** `engine/transformation/producers/internal_native.py`.
- **Source:** `docs/COBOL_UNIVERSALITY_ROADMAP.md` §12 P0-1; static read.
- **Impact:** Any consumer of producer metadata received a false UNSUPPORTED for
  supported sends and a false SUPPORTED for `GO TO`. Direct capability-trust defect.
- **Remediation:** Derive both lists from `CONSTRUCT_REGISTRY` by capability level so
  contradiction is impossible by construction; PARTIAL constructs are claimed by
  neither list.
- **Acceptance criteria / tests:**
  `tests/transformation/test_capability_registry_reconciliation.py` (11 tests) —
  no supported claim is registry UNSUPPORTED/PARTIAL, no unsupported claim is registry
  SUPPORTED/PARTIAL, every registry SUPPORTED/UNSUPPORTED key is represented, and the
  exact P0-1 cases (`GO TO`, `COMPUTE`, `SUBTRACT`, `MULTIPLY`, `CALL`, `EVALUATE`).
- **Evidence:** `python -m pytest tests/transformation/test_capability_registry_reconciliation.py tests/transformation/test_producer_contract.py` → 29 passed (2026-10-10).
- **Last verified commit:** (this session commit — see `opencode.md`).

### BL-002 — COMP / COMP-3 USAGE silently ignored (no diagnostic, no registry key)
- **Type:** defect (no silent loss)
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this session)
- **Observed behavior:** `PIC S9(4) COMP` parses with zero diagnostics; the USAGE
  clause and its storage-encoding semantics are dropped without a trace.
  `engine/transformation/cobol_parser.py` had no `USAGE`/`COMP`/`COMP-3` handling and
  `DataItem` carried no usage field; the registry had no `COMP`/`COMP-3` keys.
- **Expected behavior:** Master README Sections 18/19/60: recognized constructs must
  produce explicit diagnostics and honest capability classification, never silent loss.
- **Root cause:** USAGE clause never modeled.
- **Affected files:** `engine/transformation/cobol_parser.py`,
  `engine/transformation/ir.py`, `engine/transformation/semantic_capability.py`,
  `engine/modernization/capability_analyzer.py`,
  `engine/transformation/application_discovery.py`,
  `docs/SEMANTIC_PROOF_MATRIX.md`.
- **Source:** `docs/COBOL_UNIVERSALITY_ROADMAP.md` §12 P0-2 / §6.1.
- **Impact:** Silent narrowing of numeric storage semantics; false confidence for
  COMP/COMP-3 workloads.
- **Remediation (implemented):**
  * `DataItem.usage: str | None` records the canonical USAGE token (COMP, COMP-1,
    COMP-2, COMP-3, COMP-5; synonyms COMPUTATIONAL/BINARY/PACKED-DECIMAL collapse;
    DISPLAY/absent → None).
  * Parser extracts the clause in WORKING-STORAGE, FILE SECTION and
    `parse_data_description_lines` (copybooks), and emits a non-blocking
    `PARTIAL_SUPPORT` diagnostic per item.
  * Registry keys `COMP`/`COMP-1`/`COMP-2`/`COMP-3`/`COMP-5` at PARTIAL
    ("value semantics only; byte encoding excluded"); `canonical_usage` +
    `USAGE_TO_CONSTRUCT` helpers; source patterns for the copybook classifier.
  * Capability analyzer walks `DataItem.usage` and classifies the program PARTIAL;
    discovery filters `PARTIAL_SUPPORT` out of the loss channel so it never forces
    UNSUPPORTED. Mapper/runtime behavior unchanged.
- **Acceptance criteria / tests:**
  `tests/transformation/test_usage_capability.py` (22 tests) — parser records usage
  (incl. synonyms, file-section, literal/field-name negatives), emits
  PARTIAL_SUPPORT, analyzer classifies `workload-comp`/`workload-comp3` PARTIAL
  (never SUPPORTED), no-usage program stays SUPPORTED, registry keys PARTIAL.
- **Evidence:** `pytest tests/transformation/test_usage_capability.py` → 22 passed;
  `workload-comp`/`workload-comp3` → PARTIAL (2026-10-10).
- **Last verified commit:** (this session commit — see `opencode.md`).

### BL-003 — REDEFINES / OCCURS / 88-level mapping unverified, no registry keys
- **Type:** defect (capability truth)
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this session)
- **Observed behavior:** Fixtures `workload-redefines`, `workload-occurs`,
  `workload-level88` parse, but no mapping-output or runtime evidence was found and
  the registry has no keys for `REDEFINES`, `OCCURS`, or 88-level conditions.
- **Expected behavior:** Master README Sections 19/60; roadmap P0-3. A construct that
  parses but is unproven must not be presented as supported.
- **Affected files:** `engine/transformation/semantic_capability.py`,
  `engine/modernization/capability_analyzer.py`, `docs/SEMANTIC_PROOF_MATRIX.md`.
- **Source:** roadmap §10 / §12 P0-3.
- **Impact:** Parsed-but-unproven constructs invite false confidence.
- **Remediation (implemented):**
  * Registry keys `REDEFINES` / `OCCURS` / `88-LEVEL` at UNKNOWN (fail-closed,
    never SUPPORTED) until a full-ladder runtime proof exists.
  * Source patterns for the copybook classifier (data-division scan).
  * Capability analyzer scans the DATA DIVISION explicitly (the procedure-
    restricted scan cannot see these) and emits UNKNOWN findings.
  * Negative tests: `OCCURS DEPENDING ON` blocked; 88-level program UNKNOWN;
    plain program stays SUPPORTED.
- **Acceptance criteria / tests:**
  `tests/transformation/test_structural_capability.py` (9 tests) — registry keys
  UNKNOWN, `workload-redefines`/`workload-occurs` UNKNOWN, `workload-level88`
  non-SUPPORTED, minimal 88-level UNKNOWN, `OCCURS DEPENDING ON` blocked, plain
  program SUPPORTED.
- **Evidence:** `pytest tests/transformation/test_structural_capability.py` →
  9 passed; fixtures redefines/occurs → UNKNOWN (2026-10-10).
- **Last verified commit:** (this session commit — see `opencode.md`).

### BL-004 — BY CONTENT / BY VALUE capability hole
- **Type:** defect (capability truth)
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this session)
- **Observed behavior:** Mapper implements sync-in/no-sync-out for BY CONTENT/BY VALUE;
  fixtures exist; no registry key means capability UNKNOWN, and no dedicated runtime
  comparison was found.
- **Expected behavior:** roadmap P0-4; honest classification of parameter modes.
- **Affected files:** `engine/transformation/semantic_capability.py`,
  `engine/modernization/capability_analyzer.py`, `docs/SEMANTIC_PROOF_MATRIX.md`.
- **Impact:** Parameter-mode divergence is a classic silent-divergence source.
- **Remediation (implemented):**
  * Registry keys `BY CONTENT` / `BY VALUE` at PARTIAL (sync-in / no-sync-out
    implemented, callee writes lost — correct COBOL semantics — runtime proof
    pending).
  * Analyzer inspects `CallStatement.passing_modes` and emits a PARTIAL finding
    for CONTENT/VALUE; BY REFERENCE stays covered by the CALL SUPPORTED verdict.
- **Acceptance criteria / tests:**
  `tests/transformation/test_passing_mode_capability.py` (8 tests) — registry keys
  PARTIAL, `workload-by-content`/`workload-by-value` MAIN PARTIAL, minimal
  BY CONTENT/BY VALUE programs PARTIAL, BY REFERENCE not PARTIAL.
- **Evidence:** `pytest tests/transformation/test_passing_mode_capability.py` →
  8 passed; fixtures MAIN → PARTIAL (2026-10-10).
- **Last verified commit:** (this session commit — see `opencode.md`).

### BL-005 — ROUNDED flag consumption unverified
- **Type:** defect (capability truth)
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this session); recorded symptom was falsified
- **Observed behavior:** `ROUNDED` is parsed into IR on arithmetic statements but no
  mapping evidence found; no registry key.
- **Expected behavior:** roadmap P0-5 — prove the flag reaches Java or mark mapping
  UNKNOWN with a negative test.
- **Affected files:** `engine/transformation/semantic_capability.py`,
  `engine/modernization/capability_analyzer.py`, `docs/SEMANTIC_PROOF_MATRIX.md`.
- **Impact:** Rounding is a numeric-semantics risk area (Master README Section 18).
- **Premise correction:** the recorded symptom ("parsed into IR but no mapping
  evidence found") was **falsified during remediation**. The flag already reaches
  Java: `stmt.rounded` selects `java.math.RoundingMode.HALF_UP` on the receiving
  item (`_apply_numeric_receiver_semantics`), with the default staying `DOWN`
  truncation, and the pre-existing suite
  `tests/transformation/test_decimal_arithmetic_semantics.py` (10 tests) already
  asserted it. The defect was purely that the registry had no key.
- **Remediation (implemented):**
  * Registry key `ROUNDED` at SUPPORTED with mapping evidence.
  * Source pattern for ROUNDED.
  * Analyzer reads the `rounded` IR flag in the statement walk, so the verdict is
    backed by the parsed flag and the source scan no longer reports it as
    source-only.
- **Acceptance criteria / tests:**
  `tests/transformation/test_rounded_capability.py` (7 tests) — registry key
  SUPPORTED, source pattern detects it, ROUNDED program classifies SUPPORTED,
  flag reaches Java as HALF_UP, default stays truncation, plain program SUPPORTED.
- **Evidence:** `pytest tests/transformation/test_rounded_capability.py` → 7 passed
  (2026-10-10).
- **Last verified commit:** (this session commit — see `opencode.md`).

## P1 — required workflow / operational gaps

### BL-006 — No central defect/gap backlog existed
- **Type:** documentation/process
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this file created)
- **Observed behavior:** Master README Section 77 requires a central backlog; none
  existed (only `docs/REMEDIATION_MATRIX.md` and roadmap prose).
- **Remediation:** This document.

### BL-007 — `opencode.md` checkpoint was stale
- **Type:** documentation/process
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10
- **Observed behavior:** `opencode.md` claimed HEAD `7ae5873`, clean working tree, and
  prerequisites-not-installed, while the working tree had untracked files and the
  remote was one commit ahead (`81e7955`). It was also untracked in git.
- **Remediation:** Rewritten as a live checkpoint and committed (Master README
  Sections 64–68).
- **Evidence:** See `opencode.md`.

### BL-008 — Integrated-proof wiring claim contradicts code
- **Type:** documentation contradiction
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this session)
- **Observed behavior:** `docs/SYSTEMAOPS_PRODUCT_STATUS.md` §18 states
  "`integrated_proof_from_pipelines` not yet wired into `api/service.py` (Phase E)",
  but `api/service.py` now calls `integrated_proof_from_pipelines` /
  `runtime_evidence_from_result` and persists
  `run.modernization_report["integrated_proof"]`, exposed via
  `api/app.py:get_run_integrated_proof` and `services/service.py:get_integrated_proof`.
- **Expected behavior:** Master README Section 78 — reconcile contradictions via an
  explicit documented decision; actual repository state wins.
- **Affected files:** `docs/SYSTEMAOPS_PRODUCT_STATUS.md` (and any doc echoing it).
- **Impact:** Documentation understates implemented behavior; undermines trust in
  status docs.
- **Remediation (implemented):** `docs/SYSTEMAOPS_PRODUCT_STATUS.md` §18 now records
  the wired proof path with its concrete locations (`api/service.py`
  `runtime_evidence_from_result` during validation, persistence as
  `run.modernization_report["integrated_proof"]`, `get_integrated_proof` with a
  recompute fallback, and the `api/app.py` route), and explicitly notes that the
  earlier "not yet wired" claim contradicted the code and was removed. No other
  document echoed the stale claim, so nothing else needed changing.
- **Verification level:** VERIFIED by static read of `api/service.py` lines 164, 230,
  986–1016, 1142–1160 and `api/app.py` line 615.

### BL-009 — Live status documents cite a stale baseline commit / CI run
- **Type:** documentation contradiction
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this session)
- **Observed behavior:** `README.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`,
  `docs/SYSTEMAOPS_PRODUCT_STATUS.md`, `docs/CURRENT_DELIVERY_STATUS.md`,
  `docs/VERIFICATION_STATUS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/CONTRACT_STATUS.md`,
  `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `docs/REMEDIATION_MATRIX.md`,
  `docs/reports/CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE.md` all cited baseline `fedb7dd` /
  Push CI #417 / PR CI #418, while HEAD had moved well past that.
- **Expected behavior:** Master README Section 78 — every live status report must
  identify its verified commit and audit date.
- **Impact:** Readers cannot tell which commit the status describes; drift risk.
- **Remediation (implemented):** added a dated **Baseline note** to the header of
  all ten live status documents, stating that their SHA / CI run IDs are a dated
  snapshot rather than a live pointer, and that the current verified commit and
  CI conclusions live in `opencode.md` and `docs/BACKLOG.md`.  The documented
  remediation choice was "explicitly label the older references as of their date"
  rather than rewriting historical references, so no historical run ID was
  altered.  `docs/COBOL_UNIVERSALITY_ROADMAP.md` was deliberately **not**
  annotated: its `fedb7dd` / #417 / #418 references are part of the historical
  audit narrative (and it already tracks a newer baseline), so rewriting them
  would destroy provenance.
- **Verification level:** VERIFIED by static read of all ten files.

### BL-010 — Docker-dependent validation blocked on this host
- **Type:** operations/environment
- **Status:** BLOCKED (environment)
- **Observed behavior:** The Windows/WSL2 Docker bind-mount and cgroup issue prevents
  Docker-in-Docker binding on this workstation. Java/Node are also absent locally.
- **Expected behavior:** Master README Sections 34/50 — Docker is authoritative and
  fresh E2E must run; blocked Docker validation must use the Linux CI environment.
- **Impact:** Docker-backed backend/oracle/fresh-E2E gates cannot be re-run locally.
- **Remediation:** Do not retry Docker-in-Docker or change WSL2/kernel/cgroup/Docker
  security settings (explicit instruction). Run Python-only regression locally and
  rely on Linux CI for Docker-dependent validation.
- **Verification level:** environment-observed.

---

## P2 — coverage, quality, documentation

### BL-011 — Reconciliation audit hook (producer lists ⊆ registry) not enforced in CI
- **Type:** test/quality
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this session)
- **Observed behavior:** roadmap §16 recommends a reconciliation test; BL-001 added
  one for the internal native producer only. No generic guard covered every producer.
- **Remediation (implemented):**
  * New `tests/transformation/test_producer_capability_consistency.py` covers **both**
    producers under `engine/transformation/producers/`.
  * Deterministic-lane producers must agree with the registry in **both**
    directions; every producer (any lane) must declare a non-empty capability
    surface, never claim a construct both ways, and only use members that are
    registry keys or declared structural vocabulary.
  * `test_capability_registry_reconciliation.py` extended: every registry key must
    resolve to a verdict automatically (so BL-002…BL-005 keys could not be added
    without the producer noticing), and PARTIAL/UNKNOWN keys must appear in neither
    list.
  * Hoisted the opensource4j adapter's inline capability tuples to module-level
    `_PRODUCER_SUPPORTED_CONSTRUCTS` / `_PRODUCER_UNSUPPORTED_CONSTRUCTS` so its
    claims are inspectable without running the external compiler.
- **Scope decision (documented, not erased):** the opensource4j adapter is an
  *external* lane requiring `libcobj.jar`, not the deterministic lane the registry
  describes. It legitimately claims `GO TO` / `SORT`, which our mapper cannot
  express. Forcing it to mirror the registry would falsify its real behaviour, so
  the divergence is now **asserted explicitly** by
  `test_external_producer_divergence_is_known_and_bounded` (which pins the exact
  divergence set) instead of being hidden.
- **Verification level:** VERIFIED (both producers; 67 tests pass in the focused run).

### BL-012 — CI depth below roadmap target
- **Type:** test/quality
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Observed behavior:** CI runs ingestion, backend/oracle/Docker, frontend tests/build.
  No coverage thresholds, mutation testing, or capability-reconciliation gate.
- **Source:** Master README Sections 51/54 (P2), `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` P2.
- **Remediation (proposed):** Add reconciliation gate (BL-011) and targeted coverage
  thresholds after P0 items.
- **Verification level:** STATIC only.

## Backlog change log

- 2026-10-10 — Initial backlog created from the Master-README-mandated audit
  (Sections 76–77). BL-001 fixed; BL-006/BL-007 fixed; BL-011 partially fixed.
- 2026-10-10 — BL-002 fixed: USAGE clause now recorded on `DataItem.usage`,
  PARTIAL_SUPPORT diagnostic emitted, registry keys `COMP`/`COMP-1`/`COMP-2`/
  `COMP-3`/`COMP-5` at PARTIAL, analyzer classifies `workload-comp`/
  `workload-comp3` PARTIAL (22 new tests).
- 2026-10-10 — BL-003 fixed: registry keys `REDEFINES`/`OCCURS`/`88-LEVEL` at
  UNKNOWN (fail-closed), data-division source scan in the analyzer, fixtures
  `workload-redefines`/`workload-occurs` now UNKNOWN (9 new tests).
- 2026-10-10 — BL-004 fixed: registry keys `BY CONTENT`/`BY VALUE` at PARTIAL,
  analyzer inspects `CallStatement.passing_modes`, fixtures
  `workload-by-content`/`workload-by-value` MAIN now PARTIAL (8 new tests).
- 2026-10-10 — BL-005 fixed with a premise correction: ROUNDED already reached
  Java (`RoundingMode.HALF_UP`), so the registry key was simply missing. Key
  added at SUPPORTED and the analyzer now reads the `rounded` IR flag (7 new
  tests). All P0 capability items (BL-001…BL-005) are now closed.
- 2026-10-10 — BL-011 fixed: reconciliation guard now covers both producers;
  registry-key auto-classification and PARTIAL/UNKNOWN non-claiming guards added;
  opensource4j declared tuples hoisted to module scope; external-lane divergence
  pinned explicitly rather than forced to match the registry.
- 2026-10-10 — BL-008 and BL-009 fixed: the false "integrated proof not wired"
  claim was replaced with the real wiring + locations, and ten live status docs
  now carry a dated Baseline note distinguishing their snapshot SHA/CI from the
  live pointers in `opencode.md` / `docs/BACKLOG.md`. Historical references were
  labelled, not rewritten.
