# SystemaOps Defect and Gap Backlog

**Status:** live backlog (authoritative per Master README Section 77).
**Audit date:** 2026-10-10 (Phase 0 closure remediation)
**Audited repository:** `Shankar373/Cobol-Java-Transformation`
**Audited branch:** `codex/universal-core`
**Audit baseline HEAD:** `55f885dae77bd415fc60db6d90e59ef26fc47944` ("docs(checkpoint): record final local regression and CI job status")
**Baseline CI:** [Push CI #453 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/Shankar373/Cobol-Java-Transformation/actions/runs/38045547063), [PR CI #454 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/Shankar373/Cobol-Java-Transformation/actions/runs/38045549842), [Supply chain #35 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/Shankar373/Cobol-Java-Transformation/actions/runs/38045547098), [Supply chain #36 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/Shankar373/Cobol-Java-Transformation/actions/runs/38045549866).
**Note:** These are baseline results. Fresh CI for the documentation remediation commit must be verified separately before Phase 0 is marked complete.

Authority hierarchy (Master README Section 78):
`MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_README.md` > `opencode.md` > registries/contracts > current verification/status reports > historical reports.

Priority guidance (Master README Section 77): P0 = incorrect business semantics, false VERIFIED/certification, trust-boundary bypass, critical security exposure, or
data-loss risk; P1 = major required workflow/capability failure; P2 = important
coverage/quality/documentation gap; P3 = lower-risk improvement.

Verification vocabulary: **VERIFIED** (reproduced this audit with cited evidence),
**STATIC** (read from source/tests, not executed here), **HISTORICAL** (previously
produced evidence, not re-run here).

## P0 — correctness, capability truth, trust

### BL-001 — Producer capability declaration contradicted the authoritative registry
- **Type:** defect (capability truth)
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this audit/implementation session)
- **Observed behavior:** `engine/transformation/producers/internal_native.py` returned
  a hand-maintained `supported_constructs`/`unsupported_constructs` list on every
  `TransformationResult`. It declared `GO TO` **supported** (registry: UNSUPPORTED),
  `OCCURS` supported (no registry key; mapping unverified), and `COMPUTE`,
  `SUBTRACT`, `MULTIPLY`, `CALL`, `EVALUATE` **unsupported** (registry: SUPPORTED).
- **Expected behavior:** Producer metadata must never contradict the authoritative
  registry (`engine/transformation/semantic_capability.py`), per Master README
  Sections 14 and 77 and `docs/COBOL_UNIVERSALITY_ROADMAP.md` P0-1.
- **Root cause:** Stale duplicated capability list that drifted from the registry.
- **Affected files:** `engine/transformation/producers/internal_native.py`.
- **Source:** `docs/COBOL_UNIVERSALITY_ROADMAP.md` §12 P0-1; static read.
- **Impact:** Any consumer of producer metadata received a false UNSUPPORTED for
  supported sends and a false SUPPORTED for `GO TO`. Direct capability-trust defect.
- **Remediation:** Derive both lists from `CONSTRUCT_REGISTRY` by capability level so
  contradiction is impossible by construction; PARTIAL constructs are claimed by
  neither list.
- **Acceptance criteria / tests:**
  `tests/transformation/test_capability_registry_reconciliation.py` (11 tests) —
  no supported claim is registry UNSUPPORTED/PARTIAL, no unsupported claim is registry
  SUPPORTED/PARTIAL, every registry SUPPORTED/UNSUPPORTED key is represented, and the
  exact P0-1 cases (`GO TO`, `COMPUTE`, `SUBTRACT`, `MULTIPLY`, `CALL`, `EVALUATE`).
- **Evidence:** `python -m pytest tests/transformation/test_capability_registry_reconciliation.py tests/transformation/test_producer_contract.py` → 29 passed (2026-10-10).
- **Last verified commit:** (this session commit — see `opencode.md`).

### BL-002 — COMP / COMP-3 USAGE silently ignored (no diagnostic, no registry key)
- **Type:** defect (no silent loss)
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this session)
- **Observed behavior:** `PIC S9(4) COMP` parses with zero diagnostics; the USAGE
  clause and its storage-encoding semantics are dropped without a trace.
  `engine/transformation/cobol_parser.py` had no `USAGE`/`COMP`/`COMP-3` handling and
  `DataItem` carried no usage field; the registry had no `COMP`/`COMP-3` keys.
- **Expected behavior:** Master README Sections 18/19/60: recognized constructs must
  produce explicit diagnostics and honest capability classification, never silent loss.
- **Root cause:** USAGE clause never modeled.
- **Affected files:** `engine/transformation/cobol_parser.py`,
  `engine/transformation/ir.py`, `engine/transformation/semantic_capability.py`,
  `engine/modernization/capability_analyzer.py`,
  `engine/transformation/application_discovery.py`,
  `docs/SEMANTIC_PROOF_MATRIX.md`.
- **Source:** `docs/COBOL_UNIVERSALITY_ROADMAP.md` §12 P0-2 / §6.1.
- **Impact:** Silent narrowing of numeric storage semantics; false confidence for
  COMP/COMP-3 workloads.
- **Remediation (implemented):**
  * `DataItem.usage: str | None` records the canonical USAGE token (COMP, COMP-1,
    COMP-2, COMP-3, COMP-5; synonyms COMPUTATIONAL/BINARY/PACKED-DECIMAL collapse;
    DISPLAY/absent → None).
  * Parser extracts the clause in WORKING-STORAGE, FILE SECTION and
    `parse_data_description_lines` (copybooks), and emits a non-blocking
    `PARTIAL_SUPPORT` diagnostic per item.
  * Registry keys `COMP`/`COMP-1`/`COMP-2`/`COMP-3`/`COMP-5` at PARTIAL
    ("value semantics only; byte encoding excluded"); `canonical_usage` +
    `USAGE_TO_CONSTRUCT` helpers; source patterns for the copybook classifier.
  * Capability analyzer walks `DataItem.usage` and classifies the program PARTIAL;
    discovery filters `PARTIAL_SUPPORT` out of the loss channel so it never forces
    UNSUPPORTED. Mapper/runtime behavior unchanged.
- **Acceptance criteria / tests:**
  `tests/transformation/test_usage_capability.py` (22 tests) — parser records usage
  (incl. synonyms, file-section, literal/field-name negatives), emits
  PARTIAL_SUPPORT, analyzer classifies `workload-comp`/`workload-comp3` PARTIAL
  (never SUPPORTED), no-usage program stays SUPPORTED, registry keys PARTIAL.
- **Evidence:** `pytest tests/transformation/test_usage_capability.py` → 22 passed;
  `workload-comp`/`workload-comp3` → PARTIAL (2026-10-10).
- **Last verified commit:** (this session commit — see `opencode.md`).

### BL-003 — REDEFINES / OCCURS / 88-level mapping unverified, no registry keys
- **Type:** defect (capability truth)
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this session)
- **Observed behavior:** Fixtures `workload-redefines`, `workload-occurs`,
  `workload-level88` parse, but no mapping-output or runtime evidence was found and
  the registry has no keys for `REDEFINES`, `OCCURS`, or 88-level conditions.
- **Expected behavior:** Master README Sections 19/60; roadmap P0-3. A construct that
  parses but is unproven must not be presented as supported.
- **Affected files:** `engine/transformation/semantic_capability.py`,
  `engine/modernization/capability_analyzer.py`, `docs/SEMANTIC_PROOF_MATRIX.md`.
- **Source:** roadmap §10 / §12 P0-3.
- **Impact:** Parsed-but-unproven constructs invite false confidence.
- **Remediation (implemented):**
  * Registry keys `REDEFINES` / `OCCURS` / `88-LEVEL` at UNKNOWN (fail-closed,
    never SUPPORTED) until a full-ladder runtime proof exists.
  * Source patterns for the copybook classifier (data-division scan).
  * Capability analyzer scans the DATA DIVISION explicitly (the procedure-
    restricted scan cannot see these) and emits UNKNOWN findings.
  * Negative tests: `OCCURS DEPENDING ON` blocked; 88-level program UNKNOWN;
    plain program stays SUPPORTED.
- **Acceptance criteria / tests:**
  `tests/transformation/test_structural_capability.py` (9 tests) — registry keys
  UNKNOWN, `workload-redefines`/`workload-occurs` UNKNOWN, `workload-level88`
  non-SUPPORTED, minimal 88-level UNKNOWN, `OCCURS DEPENDING ON` blocked, plain
  program SUPPORTED.
- **Evidence:** `pytest tests/transformation/test_structural_capability.py` →
  9 passed; fixtures redefines/occurs → UNKNOWN (2026-10-10).
- **Last verified commit:** (this session commit — see `opencode.md`).

### BL-004 — BY CONTENT / BY VALUE capability hole
- **Type:** defect (capability truth)
- **Status:** **RESOLVED BY DESIGN DECISION — no code change** (2026-10-10)
- **Observed behavior:** Mapper implements sync-in/no-sync-out for BY CONTENT/BY VALUE;
  fixtures exist; no registry key means capability UNKNOWN, and no dedicated runtime
  comparison was found.
- **Expected behavior:** roadmap P0-4; honest classification of parameter modes.
- **Impact:** Parameter-mode divergence is a classic silent-divergence source.
- **Premise correction (CI evidence):** an earlier attempt in this session added
  `BY CONTENT`/`BY VALUE` registry keys at PARTIAL.  CI run #435/#436/#437/#438
  failed on `test_by_value_and_by_content_are_never_claimed_supported`, which
  asserts these modes must **never** appear as registry keys.  That negative
  contract is deliberate and predates this session: it encodes the repository's
  choice of the roadmap P0-4 option "**keep blocked**".
- **Resolution:** the registry keys and the analyzer classification were reverted.
  The conservative contract is preserved and is now documented explicitly:
  * `semantic_capability.py` carries a comment stating the modes are deliberately
    keyless, citing the negative contract test.
  * `capability_analyzer.py` records that an unproven passing mode must not derive
    a support verdict — matching the existing rule on `_analyze_call_linkage_arity`
    ("a mode that cannot be proven compatible is never guessed").
  * `docs/SEMANTIC_PROOF_MATRIX.md` documents the modes as *deliberately
    unclassified (blocked)* rather than PARTIAL.
  * Rationale: no registry key means no consumer can read a support verdict out
    of these modes, which is the conservative outcome. Mapper behavior is
    unchanged and remains correct COBOL value semantics.
- **Verification level:** VERIFIED — the previously failing contract test now
  passes (26 passed in `test_phase_d_negative_integration.py`).

### BL-005 — ROUNDED flag consumption unverified
- **Type:** defect (capability truth)
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this session); recorded symptom was falsified
- **Observed behavior:** `ROUNDED` is parsed into IR on arithmetic statements but no
  mapping evidence found; no registry key.
- **Expected behavior:** roadmap P0-5 — prove the flag reaches Java or mark mapping
  UNKNOWN with a negative test.
- **Affected files:** `engine/transformation/semantic_capability.py`,
  `engine/modernization/capability_analyzer.py`, `docs/SEMANTIC_PROOF_MATRIX.md`.
- **Impact:** Rounding is a numeric-semantics risk area (Master README Section 18).
- **Premise correction:** the recorded symptom ("parsed into IR but no mapping
  evidence found") was **falsified during remediation**. The flag already reaches
  Java: `stmt.rounded` selects `java.math.RoundingMode.HALF_UP` on the receiving
  item (`_apply_numeric_receiver_semantics`), with the default staying `DOWN`
  truncation, and the pre-existing suite
  `tests/transformation/test_decimal_arithmetic_semantics.py` (10 tests) already
  asserted it. The defect was purely that the registry had no key.
- **Remediation (implemented):**
  * Registry key `ROUNDED` at SUPPORTED with mapping evidence.
  * Source pattern for ROUNDED.
  * Analyzer reads the `rounded` IR flag in the statement walk, so the verdict is
    backed by the parsed flag and the source scan no longer reports it as
    source-only.
- **Acceptance criteria / tests:**
  `tests/transformation/test_rounded_capability.py` (7 tests) — registry key
  SUPPORTED, source pattern detects it, ROUNDED program classifies SUPPORTED,
  flag reaches Java as HALF_UP, default stays truncation, plain program SUPPORTED.
- **Evidence:** `pytest tests/transformation/test_rounded_capability.py` → 7 passed
  (2026-10-10).
- **Last verified commit:** (this session commit — see `opencode.md`).

## P1 — required workflow / operational gaps

### BL-006 — No central defect/gap backlog existed
- **Type:** documentation/process
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this file created)
- **Observed behavior:** Master README Section 77 requires a central backlog; none
  existed (only `docs/REMEDIATION_MATRIX.md` and roadmap prose).
- **Remediation:** This document.

### BL-007 — `opencode.md` checkpoint was stale
- **Type:** documentation/process
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10
- **Observed behavior:** `opencode.md` claimed HEAD `7ae5873`, clean working tree, and
  prerequisites-not-installed, while the working tree had untracked files and the
  remote was one commit ahead (`81e7955`). It was also untracked in git.
- **Remediation:** Rewritten as a live checkpoint and committed (Master README
  Sections 64–68).
- **Evidence:** See `opencode.md`.

### BL-008 — Integrated-proof wiring claim contradicts code
- **Type:** documentation contradiction
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this session)
- **Observed behavior:** `docs/SYSTEMAOPS_PRODUCT_STATUS.md` §18 states
  "`integrated_proof_from_pipelines` not yet wired into `api/service.py` (Phase E)",
  but `api/service.py` now calls `integrated_proof_from_pipelines` /
  `runtime_evidence_from_result` and persists
  `run.modernization_report["integrated_proof"]`, exposed via
  `api/app.py:get_run_integrated_proof` and `services/service.py:get_integrated_proof`.
- **Expected behavior:** Master README Section 78 — reconcile contradictions via an
  explicit documented decision; actual repository state wins.
- **Affected files:** `docs/SYSTEMAOPS_PRODUCT_STATUS.md` (and any doc echoing it).
- **Impact:** Documentation understates implemented behavior; undermines trust in
  status docs.
- **Remediation (implemented):** `docs/SYSTEMAOPS_PRODUCT_STATUS.md` §18 now records
  the wired proof path with its concrete locations (`api/service.py`
  `runtime_evidence_from_result` during validation, persistence as
  `run.modernization_report["integrated_proof"]`, `get_integrated_proof` with a
  recompute fallback, and the `api/app.py` route), and explicitly notes that the
  earlier "not yet wired" claim contradicted the code and was removed. No other
  document echoed the stale claim, so nothing else needed changing.
- **Verification level:** VERIFIED by static read of `api/service.py` lines 164, 230,
  986–1016, 1142–1160 and `api/app.py` line 615.

### BL-009 — Live status documents cite a stale baseline commit / CI run
- **Type:** documentation contradiction
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this session)
- **Observed behavior:** `README.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`,
  `docs/SYSTEMAOPS_PRODUCT_STATUS.md`, `docs/CURRENT_DELIVERY_STATUS.md`,
  `docs/VERIFICATION_STATUS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/CONTRACT_STATUS.md`,
  `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `docs/REMEDIATION_MATRIX.md`,
  `docs/reports/CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE.md` all cited baseline `fedb7dd` /
  Push CI #417 / PR CI #418, while HEAD had moved well past that.
- **Expected behavior:** Master README Section 78 — every live status report must
  identify its verified commit and audit date.
- **Impact:** Readers cannot tell which commit the status describes; drift risk.
- **Remediation (implemented):** added a dated **Baseline note** to the header of
  all ten live status documents, stating that their SHA / CI run IDs are a dated
  snapshot rather than a live pointer, and that the current verified commit and
  CI conclusions live in `opencode.md` and `docs/BACKLOG.md`.  The documented
  remediation choice was "explicitly label the older references as of their date"
  rather than rewriting historical references, so no historical run ID was
  altered.  `docs/COBOL_UNIVERSALITY_ROADMAP.md` was deliberately **not**
  annotated: its `fedb7dd` / #417 / #418 references are part of the historical
  audit narrative (and it already tracks a newer baseline), so rewriting them
  would destroy provenance.
- **Verification level:** VERIFIED by static read of all ten files.

### BL-010 — Docker-dependent validation blocked on this host
- **Type:** operations/environment
- **Status:** BLOCKED (environment)
- **Observed behavior:** The Windows/WSL2 Docker bind-mount and cgroup issue prevents
  Docker-in-Docker binding on this workstation. Java/Node are also absent locally.
- **Expected behavior:** Master README Sections 34/50 — Docker is authoritative and
  fresh E2E must run; blocked Docker validation must use the Linux CI environment.
- **Impact:** Docker-backed backend/oracle/fresh-E2E gates cannot be re-run locally.
- **Remediation:** Do not retry Docker-in-Docker or change WSL2/kernel/cgroup/Docker
  security settings (explicit instruction). Run Python-only regression locally and
  rely on Linux CI for Docker-dependent validation.
- **Verification level:** environment-observed.

---

## P2 — coverage, quality, documentation

### BL-011 — Reconciliation audit hook (producer lists ⊆ registry) not enforced in CI
- **Type:** test/quality
- **Status:** FIXED — 2026-10-10 (this session)
- **Observed behavior:** roadmap §16 recommends a reconciliation test; BL-001 added
  one for the internal native producer only. No generic guard covered every producer.
- **Remediation (implemented):**
  * New `tests/transformation/test_producer_capability_consistency.py` covers **both**
    producers under `engine/transformation/producers/`.
  * Deterministic-lane producers must agree with the registry in **both**
    directions; every producer (any lane) must declare a non-empty capability
    surface, never claim a construct both ways, and only use members that are
    registry keys or declared structural vocabulary.
  * `test_capability_registry_reconciliation.py` extended: every registry key must
    resolve to a verdict automatically (so BL-002…BL-005 keys could not be added
    without the producer noticing), and PARTIAL/UNKNOWN keys must appear in neither
    list.
  * Hoisted the opensource4j adapter's inline capability tuples to module-level
    `_PRODUCER_SUPPORTED_CONSTRUCTS` / `_PRODUCER_UNSUPPORTED_CONSTRUCTS` so its
    claims are inspectable without running the external compiler.
- **Scope decision (documented, not erased):** the opensource4j adapter is an
  *external* lane requiring `libcobj.jar`, not the deterministic lane the registry
  describes. It legitimately claims `GO TO` / `SORT`, which our mapper cannot
  express. Forcing it to mirror the registry would falsify its real behaviour, so
  the divergence is now **asserted explicitly** by
  `test_external_producer_divergence_is_known_and_bounded` (which pins the exact
  divergence set) instead of being hidden.
- **Verification level:** VERIFIED (both producers; 67 tests pass in the focused run).

### BL-012 — CI depth below roadmap target
- **Type:** test/quality
- **Status:** PARTIALLY FIXED — 2026-10-10 (capability gate added)
- **Observed behavior:** CI ran only ingestion, backend/oracle/Docker, and
  frontend jobs. Capability truth was enforced only inside the Docker-gated
  backend job, so a producer/registry contradiction surfaced after the full
  COBOL/Java image build and was easy to misattribute. No coverage thresholds or
  mutation testing.
- **Source:** Master README Sections 51/54 (P2), `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` P2.
- **Remediation (implemented):** added a dedicated **`capability-truth`** CI job
  that runs the reconciliation/silent-loss/usage/structural/rounded gates
  (81 tests) with **only pytest installed** — no `requirements.lock`. It fails in
  about a minute instead of after the image build, and the dependency-free
  install also proves the registry/analyzer/producer surface has no hidden
  third-party coupling.
- **Deliberately still open:** coverage thresholds and mutation testing are not
  added; they are not yet justified by evidence and would add CI time without a
  defined target.
- **Verification level:** VERIFIED locally and by CI on baseline `55f885d`.
  Push CI #453 and PR CI #454 both passed, including the capability-truth gate.
  Coverage thresholds and mutation testing remain explicitly deferred below.

## Backlog change log

- 2026-10-10 — Initial backlog created from the Master-README-mandated audit
  (Sections 76–77). BL-001 fixed; BL-006/BL-007 fixed; BL-011 partially fixed.
- 2026-10-10 — BL-002 fixed: USAGE clause now recorded on `DataItem.usage`,
  PARTIAL_SUPPORT diagnostic emitted, registry keys `COMP`/`COMP-1`/`COMP-2`/
  `COMP-3`/`COMP-5` at PARTIAL, analyzer classifies `workload-comp`/
  `workload-comp3` PARTIAL (22 new tests).
- 2026-10-10 — BL-003 fixed: registry keys `REDEFINES`/`OCCURS`/`88-LEVEL` at
  UNKNOWN (fail-closed), data-division source scan in the analyzer, fixtures
  `workload-redefines`/`workload-occurs` now UNKNOWN (9 new tests).
- 2026-10-10 — BL-004 closed by design decision: the PARTIAL registry keys were
  reverted after CI proved `test_by_value_and_by_content_are_never_claimed_supported`
  forbids them. The modes stay deliberately unclassified; the decision is now
  documented in the registry, the analyzer and the proof matrix.
- 2026-10-10 — BL-005 fixed with a premise correction: ROUNDED already reached
  Java (`RoundingMode.HALF_UP`), so the registry key was simply missing. Key
  added at SUPPORTED and the analyzer now reads the `rounded` IR flag (7 new
  tests). All P0 capability items (BL-001…BL-005) are now closed.
- 2026-10-10 — BL-011 fixed: reconciliation guard now covers both producers;
  registry-key auto-classification and PARTIAL/UNKNOWN non-claiming guards added;
  opensource4j declared tuples hoisted to module scope; external-lane divergence
  pinned explicitly rather than forced to match the registry.
- 2026-10-10 — BL-012 partially fixed: new dependency-free `capability-truth` CI
  job gates capability truth in ~1 minute instead of after the Docker image build.
- 2026-10-10 — BL-008 and BL-009 fixed: the false "integrated proof not wired"
  claim was replaced with the real wiring + locations, and ten live status docs
  now carry a dated Baseline note distinguishing their snapshot SHA/CI from the
  live pointers in `opencode.md` / `docs/BACKLOG.md`. Historical references were
  labelled, not rewritten.

## Phase 0 closure metadata and carry-forward register (Master README §§53, 77)

This register supplies the explicit owner/role, target phase, dependency, residual risk, reason, and acceptance criteria required for every backlog item. “Owner” is a responsible role, not a claim that a named individual has accepted assignment. Closed items retain their historical evidence above; open items remain carried forward and are not silently waived.

| ID | Owner/role | Target phase | Dependency | Reason | Residual risk | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BL-001 | Transformation producer maintainer | Phase 1–2 | `CONSTRUCT_REGISTRY` and producer contract tests | Prevent producer declarations from drifting from the canonical registry. | Future producer or registry changes could reintroduce capability drift. | Reconciliation tests pass for all deterministic producers; external-lane differences remain explicitly bounded by tests. |
| BL-002 | Parser / IR maintainer | Phase 1–2 | Canonical data-item IR and capability analyzer | Preserve COMP-family usage and avoid silent storage-semantics loss. | COMP-family byte/storage encoding remains PARTIAL; value-only handling must not imply byte-layout equivalence. | Usage token is preserved; unproven encoding is diagnosed/classified PARTIAL; no false SUPPORTED verdict; focused tests pass. |
| BL-003 | Semantic capability maintainer | Phase 2 | Data-division scanning, registry, proof matrix | Keep parsed-but-unproven structural constructs fail-closed. | REDEFINES/OCCURS/88-level semantics are not runtime-proven. | Constructs remain UNKNOWN/non-SUPPORTED until full-ladder evidence exists; negative tests pass. |
| BL-004 | Semantic architecture owner | Phase 2 | Existing negative contract for BY CONTENT/BY VALUE | Preserve the explicit “keep blocked” design decision. | Parameter-mode behavior remains deliberately unclassified and runtime equivalence is unproven. | Registry remains keyless for these modes; negative contract and focused regression tests pass. |
| BL-005 | Numeric semantics maintainer | Phase 2 | ROUNDED IR flag and receiving-item semantics | Ensure capability verdict reflects the actual IR-to-Java mapping. | Numeric edge cases outside the verified subset remain a semantic risk. | Registry verdict is backed by actual mapping; HALF_UP and default truncation tests pass. |
| BL-006 | Engineering documentation owner | Phase 0 | Master README §77 | Maintain one central record for every discovered gap. | Backlog can drift if new defects are not recorded. | Every discovered gap is represented here or linked to an authoritative tracked issue, with required metadata and evidence. |
| BL-007 | Repository/checkpoint maintainer | Phase 0 | Current branch ref and live CI results | Keep the checkpoint truthful and reproducible. | Stale checkpoint pointers can mislead subsequent implementation. | Checkpoint distinguishes audit baseline, current HEAD, and verified evidence; it never claims unverified completion. |
| BL-008 | Product documentation owner | Phase 0 | Actual service/API implementation | Keep product-status claims aligned with actual proof wiring. | Future code changes can reintroduce documentation contradictions. | Product-status statements match inspected wiring and are rechecked when those paths change. |
| BL-009 | Release documentation owner | Phase 0 | Source commit and Actions run links | Prevent historical baselines being mistaken for current proof. | Snapshot references may be misread as current if labels are removed. | Live status documents label historical snapshots and point to the live checkpoint/backlog. |
| BL-010 | Release engineering / CI owner | Phase 9 and Phase 12 | Linux CI with Docker, JDK, and GnuCOBOL | Use the supported CI environment for Docker-dependent validation. | Windows/WSL2 local Docker bind-mount/cgroup limitation remains; local Docker E2E cannot be claimed. | Docker-dependent tests execute in Linux CI on the exact candidate SHA and run/job evidence is linked; do not change WSL2/kernel/cgroup/Docker security settings as a workaround. |
| BL-011 | Test infrastructure maintainer | Phase 12 | Producer capability declarations and registry | Ensure producer reconciliation is enforced by regression tests. | New producers could bypass reconciliation if not added to the contract suite. | Every producer is covered by capability consistency tests; intentional external-lane divergence remains pinned. |
| BL-012 | CI quality-gate owner | Phase 12 | Evidence-based coverage targets and mutation-testing budget | Carry forward coverage/mutation work until a meaningful target is defined. | Coverage thresholds and mutation testing remain absent; arbitrary targets could add noise without detecting real regressions. | Define meaningful thresholds and mutation scope/budget, demonstrate detection of real regressions without weakening tests, then gate them in CI. |
| BL-013 | Repository maintainer | Phase 0 governance / Phase 12 integration | Re-diff PR #1 against current `codex/universal-core` and inspect current tests/CI | Prevent stale-branch code from being merged without revalidation. | PR #1 targets `codex/remote-docker-ci`, reported 142 commits stale; `completeness_gate.py` is not present upstream. | Either re-diff/retarget against the current branch and pass fresh CI, or close as superseded with rationale preserved; no automatic action. |
| BL-014 | Arithmetic transformation maintainer | Phase 2 | Compare PR #6 against current mapper and arithmetic tests | Avoid merging an already implemented change with a broken test patch. | PR #6 is superseded by existing `Math.addExact`/`subtractExact`/`multiplyExact` mapping; its test file contains a syntax error caused by a literal `\\n`. | Do not merge as-is. Repair and prove a non-duplicative behavior gap with focused/full tests, or close as superseded with evidence. |
| BL-015 | Project owner / human reviewer | Phase 0 governance | Full review of PR #2's 151-commit/265-file diff, exact-head CI, and explicit human decision | Keep the high-impact main-branch integration decision with the project owner. | PR #2 is mergeable and checks were green at audit time, but merging it into `main` is not authorized here. | Human explicitly chooses merge or hold after reviewing the diff and fresh checks. Until then, leave PR #2 open and unmerged; no assistant-driven merge. |
| BL-016 | QA / validation owner | Phase 0 governance | Current upstream test replacements and PR #3 validation history | Preserve the validation-only branch findings without merging stale tests. | Extracted unique tests failed against current code (41 failed, 20 passed, one import failure); concerns were reimplemented upstream. | Keep PR #3 unmerged; preserve findings and make a human decision to retain for reference or close as superseded. |
